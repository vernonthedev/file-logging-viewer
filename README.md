Exported the program into a jar and exe file that can be used as a desktop application on Microsoft Operating System.
#How the application works
The User is able to choose/ select a file from their computer and it is rendered in the application and displayed using an Edit Text 
interface that enables the user to update the text or content that was in the uploaded file.
The user has other capabilities of appending other files onto the uploaded file content by selecting another file without necessarily triggering the copy and 
paste operation on the Computer.
